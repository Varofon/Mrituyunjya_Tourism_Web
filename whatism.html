            Shiva is the truth and He is Parameshwara (The Transcendent Lord). It is believed that Lord Shiva is easy to
            please and often grants boons to his devotees. Whether it concerns money, finance, health or happiness, he
            will grant all your wishes and relieve you from your sufferings.
            Now the question that arises is how to worship Shiva? In Satyug, idol worship was helpful but in Kalyug,
            just offering prayers in front of an idol won’t suffice. Even the Bhavishya Puranas have mentioned about the
            significance of chanting mantras for happiness and peace of mind. Similarly, chanting the mantra of Shiva –
            Mahamrityunjaya mantra daily will bestow you with good health, wealth, prosperity and long life. It
            generates positive vibes and protects against calamities.<br><br>

                <div class="section-heading">Why Perform Mrityunjya Puja and Dhyan?</div>

            <div class="section-heading">Why learn the Vidya in our Mrityunjya Ashram?</div><br>
            Raw power resides in the Bhoomi. This Bhoomi or land in which the Mahamrityunjya Mandir is built is
            supremely powerful. Two Shakti’s (Powers) in their full potential are present here. One is called
            <b>Mrita
                Sanjeevani Shakti</b> and the other is known as <b>Mrityunjya Shakti.</b><br><br>
            Because of the divine and supremely powerful presence of these two Live Forces and Natural Cosmic
            Energies,
            this Bhoomi, which is known as Narasimha Kshetra, in Puronigudam, Nagaon,Assam has become most potent
            and
            powerful. Thus, anyone who visits this particular place will find the resistance power of his or her
            body
            automatically augmented and increased.<br><br>
            Thousands and Thousands of years back Guru Shukracharya had established these two powers in this place
            through His arduous Sadhna and Tapasya. <br><br>
            However unfortunately, with the passage of time, these powers, in absence of any holistic and
            ritualistic
            activities, became inactive. In the year 1999 Bramharishi Mahamrityunjya Shri Shri Bhrigugiri Maharaj-
            the
            only man on earth who is a Mahamrityunjya Siddha, after realizing the significance of this particular
            tract
            of land, discovered these two living powers and activated them again through His intense Tapobal
            (Spiritual
            Strength).<br><br>
            Gurudev also performed hundreds and hundreds of Vedic Yagnyas in this land by following specific secret
            Ancient Scientific Systems to resurrect and reinstate these powers. Thus, as soon as these ancient Vedic
            rituals (Friction) were started, the sacred super powers consequentially got rejuvenated and
            resuscitated.
            Therefore they turned active again and thereafter assumed their full potent force. Which means they
            became
            Shakti-Sampanna .<br><br>
            Presently these Shaktis are pervasive all throughout the Narasimha Kshetra and hence presently this
            Bhoomi
            has also become most supremely powerful.
            <br><br>
            Mrityunjya Bhrigugiri Maharaj has proclaimed that beneath the Mahamrityunjya Mega Structure lays hidden
            the
            ancient Mahamrityunjya Linga which was consecrated by Maharishi Shukracharya and is 51 Quintal as
            present
            weight. It is imperative to know that Raj Rishi Hiranyakashipu (Bhakta Prahlad’s Father) performed his
            Sadhna here and achieved Mahamrityunjya.In Sanskrit “Hiranya” means Gold and “Kashipu” signifies Dress.
            Thus
            the Rishi who wore the dress made of Gold and who thus performed Mahamrityunjya Sadhna is eulogized as
            Hiranyakashipu.<br><br>
            Nobody can just build a Mrityunjya temple, for had that been the case, there would have been numerous
            Mrityunjya temple in every nook and corner. Mrityunjya Sadhna is ultimate powerful and hence very few
            people
            pursue it with success. Moreover, there is no second Mrityunjya Siddha Purush present on this earth.
            Gurudev
            Bramharishi Mahamrityunjya Bhrigugiri is the only living man who is a Mahamrityunjya Siddha and His Guru
            is
            the same Immortal Mahamrityunjya Markandeya Himself, who is from the Vedic Ages. Mahamrityunjya
            Markandeya
            secretly stayed with Baba Bhrigugiri for 9 years as an ordinary man and taught him the Mahamrityunjya
            Vidya.<br><br>
            Hence, keeping the above enlightening knowledge in view, don’t think twice of visiting this sacred site.
            Have deep faith in divinity and come relish a never experienced experiential journey.
